Rules and Tips:
- A texture atlas should be referenced by only a single Texture Grid scriptable object.
- The changes you make to the texture are not automatically saved to HDD. This means that if you make some changes to the texture atlas,
   and do not save them, those changes will be lost when you close the Unity Project.
- If you have several texture atlases that are just color variations of one another, you donâ€™t need to create a Texture Grid 
   (create Flat Color Grids and Texture Rects) scriptable object for all of them. You can create a Texture Grid for one texture atlas, 
   duplicate it and replace the texture atlas it references.
- After you no longer need Palette Modifier, you can restore the original texture atlas format.
- If you add the Palette Modifier script to an object and notice that not all the object colors are in the inspector, most likely
   this is because in the Texture Grid not all flat colors are covered with a Flat Color Grid. Open the Grid Editor and make sure 
   all the flat colors and texture patterns are covered with a Flat Color Grid/Texture Pattern Rec. After that go to Misc tab and
   press Rebuild PM Data button.
- Break Color Sharing works only on flat colors. If an object has both flat colors and texture patterns, PM will move the UVs to an 
  unused part of the texture only for those UVs that point to a flat color.
