Quick setup:

After you have imported the asset into your project, import the package based on the pipeline you are using: either "URP Toon Pro" or "Built-in Toon Pro". 
These can be found in the main folder "Stylized Toon Pro". 

If you are using 2021 or 2022, after importing "URP/Built-in Toon Pro" package, import also "URP/Buit-in 2021/2022 - only shader" package. 
It contains updated versions of the shader that fully support 2021 and 2022 LTS.

If you wish to modify the shader with the Amplify Shader Editor you can import amplify functions used within the shader from package called "AmplifyShaderFunctions".
